# DNA_Enhancers_Under_Shear_Stress
This project uses publicly available data to assess the effect of shear-stress on DNA transcription, comparing multiply-enhanced and singly-enhanced genes.

## Abstract


## Data Availability
Research based on [Shear stress switches the association of endothelial enhancers from ETV/ETS to KLF transcription factor binding sites (Tsarsky et al.)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08645-8#data-availability) who's data are available under GEO Accession number [GSE198221](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE198221).
